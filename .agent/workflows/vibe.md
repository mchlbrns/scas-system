# Vibe-First Development Workflow
Version: 1.0.0

Command: /vibe

## Objective
Enable intent-driven, flow-based development where the agent
leads implementation and the user steers via taste and approval.

---

## Step 1: Intent Capture
Ask:
- What are we trying to do?
- What should this feel like?
- What should we avoid?

Summarize:
- One-sentence intent
- Three vibe adjectives

No code yet.

---

## Step 2: Direction Proposal
Propose a single, opinionated direction:
- Conceptual approach
- High-level structure
- Trade-offs made intentionally

Avoid implementation details.

---

## Step 3: Vibe Check
Ask:
“Does this direction feel right?”

If not approved:
- Revise
- Do not proceed

---

## Step 4: Agent-Led Implementation
Once approved:
- Write or modify files
- Keep changes minimal
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

---

## Step 5: Vibe Review
Explain:
- What changed
- Why it matches the intended vibe

Ask for feedback.

---

## Step 6: Taste Learning Signal
If recurring feedback appears:
- Suggest running /self-update
- Do not self-modify autonomously

---

## Output Format
1. Intent Summary
2. Direction Proposal
3. Approval Prompt
4. Implementation Summary
5. Vibe Review
