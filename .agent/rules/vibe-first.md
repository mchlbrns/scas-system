# Vibe-First Development Rule

Activation: Always On

## Constraints
- Default to intent, direction, and feel before implementation
- Ask for approval before writing or modifying files
- Prefer simple, explicit, boring solutions
- Treat user feedback as taste, not technical correction

## Prohibitions
- No unsolicited code dumps
- No premature optimization
- No over-engineering unless explicitly requested

## Rationale
The goal is flow, clarity, and evolution—not perfect code.
